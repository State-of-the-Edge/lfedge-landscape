              Robin transforms the way enterprise applications drive the infrastructure by bringing together purpose-built container-aware block storage with
              application-aware manager into the cloud (private and/or public). This demonstrates unique benefits to distributed, clustered and stateful
              applications including Big-Data and Databases. With a team that includes industry veterans from leading enterprise technology companies such as
              NetApp, Oracle, and Veritas, Robin seeks to disrupt the $20 billion-plus virtualization market with its container-based compute and storage
              platform software that delivers better performance higher consolidation and a much simpler application lifecycle management than traditional
              hypervisor-based virtualization. Founded in 2013, the San Jose California-based company has raised more than $50 million in venture funding from
              leading investors such as Clear Ventures, DN Capital, USAA, Hasso Plattner Ventures and CloudScale Capital Partners.
